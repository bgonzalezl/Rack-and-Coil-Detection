# Rack-and-Coil-Detection
Code made to facilitate inventory management for big storage facilities. This program strives to make this process simpler.
This code was possible thanks to the help of Dilan Cortés Martinez (in care of the colored buttons in the work screen) and an associate from Drones México, who wrote the base for the whole GUI, the "Login" Screen and Config Screen
